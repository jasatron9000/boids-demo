# Boids Demo

This is a small project that demonstrates a small simulations of the flocking behaviour of birds. In this case, it can also replicate the behaviour of schools of fishes.

<div style="
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    margin: 1em;
">
<img src="./boid.png" width=75%>
</div>

You can visit the demo on this [site](https://jasatron9000.github.io/boids-demo)

## Built with
Programmed with **TypeScript** using the **React** framework. The simulation is a normal HTML5 Canvas element.

## Future Work
- Fix performance issues when changing the sliders.
- Fix performance issues when more than 300 boids are in the same time.
